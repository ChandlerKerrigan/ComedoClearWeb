    <div class="about">
    <P>Hi, my name is Chandler, and I created ComedoClear to empower individuals in making informed decisions about their skincare. The foundation of this application stems from my passion for technology and my commitment to helping people take control of their skin health. The comedogenic ingredient data used in this application is sourced from Platinum Skincare's Comedogenic Ratings, a trusted resource for identifying pore-clogging ingredients.<br><br>

        The term "non-comedogenic" is often misunderstood and misused in the cosmetics industry due to a lack of regulation by the FDA. Many products labeled as "non-comedogenic" still contain ingredients that can clog pores, leading to skin issues like comedones, blackheads, and even long-term acne scars. For those with sensitive skin or preexisting conditions, this misleading labeling can cause significant distress. I wanted to create a solution that simplifies the often overwhelming task of deciphering skincare ingredient lists, empowering users to make choices that genuinely benefit their skin.<br><br>
        
        ComedoClear was developed using Agile methodology, a process that allowed for iterative improvements based on user feedback. This approach ensured that the application is not only functional but also user-friendly and accessible. The application enables users to paste their skincare product's ingredient list and instantly compare it against a database of known comedogenic ingredients. The results clearly highlight pore-clogging ingredients alongside their comedogenicity scores, helping users identify potentially problematic products at a glance.<br><br>
        
        The inspiration behind ComedoClear comes from understanding the long-term impact of clogged pores and the frustration many experience when trying to find truly non-comedogenic products. By leveraging my technical skills and passion for skincare education, I aim to provide a reliable tool that helps users avoid misleading product claims and take control of their skin's health. With ComedoClear, navigating the world of skincare becomes simpler and more transparent, making it easier for everyone to prioritize their well-being.</P>
